> A small Learning-App for my GF's Linguistic class

How to use:

- Enter the answer to the question at the input line
- To see if your answer is correct: either hit enter, press the ?-Button or the Question-Card
- To get a new question: either swipe right, hit enter again or press the right arrow key
- To see the previous question: either swipe right or press the left arrow key

UPDATE: The card-flip does not work that well on iOS, Android does fine (except for some swipe bugs)
