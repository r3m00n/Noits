# Noits

> A small Learning-App for my GF's Linguistic class
> (mobile only (except you use the responsive developer tools of your browser))

How to use:

- Enter the answer to the question at the input line
- To see if your answer is correct: either hit enter, press the ?-Button or the Question-Card
- To get a new question: either swipe right, hit enter again or press the right arrow key (on a desktop)
- To see the previous question: either swipe right or press the left arrow key (on a desktop)

UPDATE: The card-flip does not work that well on iOS, Android does fine (except for some swipe bugs), for best experience use a desktop browser with a small window or (to get the swipe-experience) the responsive display in the developer tools
